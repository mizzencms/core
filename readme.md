#MizzenLite

MizzenLite provides a quick way to create simple websites utilising existing 
composer packages.

###Installation
----
> Please note that this is not even beta. It should not be used in production!
> In fact at the moment it should hardly be used at all due to expected
> namespace change.

[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/strayobject/mizzenlite) and
